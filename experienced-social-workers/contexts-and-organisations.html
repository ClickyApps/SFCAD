	    			<h1>Contexts and Organisations</h1>
	    			<h6>Engage with, inform, and adapt to changing contexts that shape practice. Operate effectively within own organisational frameworks and contribute to the development of services and organisations. Operate effectively within multi-agency and inter-professional partnerships and settings.</h6>
	    			<p>Social workers are informed about and pro-actively responsive to the challenges and opportunities that come with changing social contexts and constructs. They fulfil this responsibility in accordance with their professional values and ethics, both as individual professionals and as members of the organisation in which they work. They collaborate, inform and are informed by their work with others, inter-professionally and with communities.</p>
	    			<h3>Practitioners at this level should:</h3>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li>Contribute positively to the dialogue about opportunities and constraints for social work practice arising from changing local and national contexts and model proactive responses.</li>
	    				<li>Model and demonstrate the ability to work within your own organisation, and regularly work with the relationship between the organisation, practice and wider changing contexts.</li>
	    				<li>Demonstrate sound working knowledge of all relevant legal requirements and their implications for practice; support and advise others to interpret and use the law.</li>
	    				<li>Engage positively with and contribute to organisational development.</li>
	    				<li>Identify the need for the development of specialist roles and their contribution to team learning.</li>
	    				<li>Model and encourage positive working relationships in the team, promoting strategies for collaboration and a supportive team culture.</li>
	    				<li>Maintain and develop liaison across agencies at a more senior level.</li>
	    			</ul>
	    			<h3>Demonstrating your capabilities:</h3>
	    			<p>At the Experienced Social Worker level, you should be able to demonstrate that you have a more active role in the development of services in your authority and that you are taking broader responsibility for service delivery. In addition, your analysis of the impact of societal changes on the work you and your colleagues provide should be more detailed. You should be able to show that you are more actively involved with your team, helping colleagues to explore practice in more depth and developing collaboration with others to improve services.</p>
	    			<p>There is a variety of evidence to draw on in this domain, since it involves many different issues in society that have an effect on service users and the provision of services. What is happening in your organisation is also a source of material. Try to explore those sources of evidence which perhaps combine social issues and organisational ones and particularly your own involvement in progressing practice.</p>
