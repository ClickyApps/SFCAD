    			<h1>Professional Leadership</h1>
    			<h6>Take responsibility for the professional learning and development of others through supervision, mentoring, assessing, research, teaching, leadership and management.</h6>
    			<p>The social work profession evolves through the contribution of its members in activities such as practice research, supervision, assessment of practice, teaching and management. An individual’s contribution will gain influence when undertaken as part of a learning, practice-focused organisation. Learning may be facilitated with a wide range of people including social work colleagues, service users and carers, volunteers, foster carers and other professionals.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Contribute to and promote the development of practice, taking the initiative to test new approaches</li>
    				<li>Contribute to the learning of others</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>The social work profession will develop more productively if all of it members take up responsibility for it and this capability is demonstration of this. Regardless of your level in the organisation there is always some contribution to make. Think about how you make a contribution to practice in your team or service. How do you help others with learning?</p>
    			<h3>The following is an illustration of how you might do this:</h3>
    			<p>I have taken part in several induction events in my service when new staff join. I asked if I could make a contribution and I have been given the responsibility to explain what local resources are available in the area and how applications can be made to the most important ones. As a follow up exercise I have compiled a resource are on the local electronic shared drive. I have also mentored one of the social work assistants who is new to the team providing him with regular opportunities to talk through how he can get the best out of the job. I have really enjoyed this activity and it has given me food for thought about becoming a practice educator. Being a bit of a whizz with computers I am regularly called upon in the office to help newer staff with navigating the electronic recording system. I received some training at the beginning myself but since then I have mastered the process and I am happy to help others who find it more of a struggle. I am going to be part of a new initiative trialling the use of tablets machines.</p>
