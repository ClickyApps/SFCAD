    			<h1>Contexts and Organisations</h1>
    			<h6>Engage with, inform, and adapt to changing contexts that shape practice. Operate effectively within own organisational frameworks and contribute to the development of services and organisations. Operate effectively within multi-agency and inter-professional partnerships and settings.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers are informed about and pro-actively responsive to the challenges and opportunities that come with changing social contexts and constructs. They fulfil this responsibility in accordance with their professional values and ethics, both as individual professionals and as members of the organisation in which they work. They collaborate, inform and are informed by their work with others, inter-professionally and with communities.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Keep abreast of changing contexts at local and national level, and take account of these in practice</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate the ability to work within your own organisation, and identify and begin to work with the relationship between the organisation, practice and wider changing contexts</li>
    				<li>Work to and explain the relevant legal structures in the organisation, including basic case law; know when and how to access support and appropriate legal advice and consultation</li>
    				<li>Explore, and identify how organisational practice can support good social work practice</li>
    				<li>Keep abreast of changing roles in the organisation; recognise, value and engage with other specialist perspectives</li>
    				<li>Be confident about your role in the team, working positively with others; draw on and contribute to team working and collaborative support wherever possible</li>
    				<li>Take an active role in inter-professional and inter-agency work, building own network and collaborative working</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>This capability requires you to engage not only with your own organisation but also with wider social contexts and issues. These might include changes to social demographics such as the expected increase in older people in society or other social concerns such as youth unemployment, drug abuse, and the rise in the incidence of childhood autism or even the challenges presented by globalisation or the increase in use of information technology. You are advised to consider which social contexts and constructs are relevant to you and how you respond to them. You should also think about how you carry out your responsibilities as a professional social worker in your organisation. The changing social contexts and constructs are likely to impact on your work in your organisation. Think about how you and your colleagues promote good social work practice in these circumstances.</p>
    			<h3>The following case illustrates how you might tackle this capability:</h3>
    			<p>As a care manager for older people, I assess service users who are struggling to care for themselves in the community, like Mr E who is 87, lives alone and who recently developed a leg ulcer which has temporarily prevented him from caring for himself. His leg needs to be dressed every day by district nurses. I have arranged for him to have meals on wheels and some assistance at home to help him wash and get groceries. I am aware that there are more and more older people living longer and many of them require assistance to continue to live independently (AgeUK (2013) Later Life in the UK. December Factsheet.) In my authority I am also aware that the older people population is changing with more and more older people from minority ethnic communities than was the case a few years back. I have taken some responsibility in my team to liaise with community groups from where many of the minority ethnic older people are from to learn more about tailoring the delivery of personal care in ways that fit that community and helping to organise community responses to need.   I have the authority to allocate some funding to service users as personal budgets so that they can organise their own services if they want to; some are enthusiastic but other are not so keen, like Mr E. I am aware that in my authority we are developing the way personal budgets are used to make it easier for people to take them up. I liaise with other professionals in the health service like district nurses and occupational therapists so that our work together is better coordinated.</p>
