    			<h1>Intervention and Skills</h1>
    			<h6>Use judgement and authority to intervene with individuals, families and communities to promote independence, provide support and prevent harm, neglect and abuse.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers engage with individuals, families, groups and communities, working alongside people to assess and intervene. They enable effective relationships and are effective communicators, using appropriate skills. Using their professional judgement, they employ a range of interventions: promoting independence, providing support and protection, taking preventative action and ensuring safety whilst balancing rights and risks. They understand and take account of differentials in power, and are able to use authority appropriately. They evaluate their own practice and the outcomes for those they work with.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Communicate skilfully and confidently in complex or high risk situations. Model and help others to develop communication skills</li>
    				<li>Sustain and model engagement with people in fluctuating circumstances and capacities, including where there is hostility and risk</li>
    				<li>Be able to gather information quickly and effectively so as to inform judgement for interventions including in crises, and in response to challenge, or in the absence of complete information</li>
    				<li>Use assessment procedures discerningly so as to inform judgement</li>
    				<li>Maintain and expand a range of frameworks for assessment and intervention</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate skilled use of a range of frameworks for assessment and intervention</li>
    				<li>Actively support and initiate community groups and networks, including professional ones</li>
    				<li>Contribute to the development of the organisation’s information strategy and systems</li>
    				<li>Model and help others with appropriate information sharing</li>
    				<li>Model and help others to manage changing circumstances</li>
    				<li>Recognise and appropriately manage the authority inherent in your position</li>
    				<li>Anticipate, assess and manage risk, including in more complex cases, and support others to develop risk management skills</li>
    				<li>Undertake assessment and planning for safeguarding in more complex cases, and help others with safeguarding skills</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>At the Experienced Social Worker level you will need to think carefully about the complexity of the work in which you are involved and consider those cases which involve higher risk and where you have perhaps had to adapt your approach to assessment and intervention in order to make progress and where you have modelled good practice for others.</p>
    			<p>I started work with Jennifer about a year ago when her GP referred her to my team (Community Mental Health Team). She was 56, from Ireland and lived alone in a one bedroomed flat. She had a history of schizoaffective disorder, was largely uncommunicative and would sometimes completely fail to look after herself to the point where she would risk dying. When I first met her I was conscious of me being younger than her and of a different ethnicity (I am black Caribbean). I also realised that the professional network around did not appear to recognise the risks to her health and safety which her mental health problem posed. I took the time to really listen to what she had to say including how she experienced her mental health problem by drawing on skills I had learned on motivational interviewing (Treasure, J (2004) Motivational Interviewing Advances in Psychiatric Treatment 10. 331-337). I then worked with the CPN on the team and later with her GP showing them how to mirror what she said so that she knew she was being understood. This approach led to Jennifer telling the nurse and GP more about her condition. As a team we met from time to time to reflect on Jennifer’s state. We thought through the implications of her condition and lifestyle which was useful to explore further the risks she posed to herself.  In my statutory role I had to let Jennifer know what my duties were particularly as an Approved Mental Health worker. She needed to be aware that I could apply for her liberty to be restricted if the risk to her health and safety worsened. That early engagement from the team was really helpful when later it became evident that her mental health problem was deteriorating. My task was to coordinate the support and protection from the team by ensuring she always had someone to turn to, helping her to make as many decisions for herself as possible but stepping in when she needed protection. She would often not answer the door when a member of the team visited so I knew she was struggling to engage.  After a couple of attempts I eventually applied for Jennifer to be compulsorily admitted to hospital where should could receive more specialist and intensive help.</p>
