    			<h1>Values and Ethics</h1>
    			<h6>Apply social work ethical principles and values to guide professional practice.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers have an obligation to conduct themselves ethically and to engage in ethical decision-making, including through partnership with people who use their services. Social workers are knowledgeable about the value base of their profession, its ethical standards and relevant law.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Demonstrate confident and critical application of professional ethical principles to decision-making and practice, supporting others to do so using a legal and  human rights framework</li>
    				<li>Model and support others to reflect on and manage the influence and impact of own values on  professional practice</li>
    				<li>Provide guidance and support to analyse, reflect on and work with ethical dilemmas</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate confident application of an understanding of the benefits and limitations of  partnership work, support others to do so, and promote service user and carer participation in developing service delivery</li>
    				<li>Promote and advance wherever possible individual’s rights to autonomy and self-determination, providing support, guidance and challenge to others</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate skills in the sensitive exploration of issues of privacy and information-sharing in complex or risky situations, offering support and guidance to colleagues in managing such these dilemmas</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>At this level the case you chose to discuss will have to be more complex. You will be required to show that you can critically weigh up competing demands when it comes to decision making. You should be prepared to show how you have prioritised competing demands or perhaps where you have given greater weight to some information rather than others. In addition there is more emphasis at this level on you being able to model good practice for others and support other people to explore practice dilemmas.</p>
    			<h3>The case above would have a different set of emphases as follows:</h3>
    			<p>In the case of D, a 9 year old boy who was hit on the ear by his dad, a case conference was convened. My manager insisted that I recommend that D should be subject to a Child Protection Plan and that his father should no longer reside at home. I had to differ since I could see that such a strategy would contravene his father’s rights and his son’s (European Convention on Human Rights Article 8: Right to respect for private and family life.). It was clear to me that the family was under severe stress; they had three other children one of whom had significant learning disabilities particularly challenging behaviour. The incident happened during a moment when the dad was trying to control the disabled child and, whilst restraining him, he accidentally hit D’s ear. After the investigation I discussed with the parents their children’s vulnerabilities when the family was under pressure and we managed to work out how extra help from extended family members could be put to use to reduce stress and provide a break for them as carers. We drew up a plan together which they found helpful and which would negate the need for the father to live elsewhere. In supervision, I questioned the legality of making him live elsewhere with my manager and we explored the local authorities legal rights and responsibilities. We also discussed the father’s potential absence on D and we concluded that if this could be avoided then it was preferable. After exploring all of the details in the case my manager was confident that the children and D especially were safe to remain at home and we subsequently explored an alternative plan which did not require a case conference.</p>
    			<p>Alternative case examples could involve dilemmas emerging from partnership working particularly where you think it is important that to promote partnership or perhaps curtail it. In the latter instance you should be prepared to defend curtailment through a careful exploration of how it would promote other rights or duties.</p>
