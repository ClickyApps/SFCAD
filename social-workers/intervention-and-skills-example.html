    				<h1>The following illustration may help:</h1>
    				<p>I started work with J about a year ago when her GP referred her to my team (Community Mental Health Team). She was 56, from Ireland and lived alone in a one bedroomed flat. She had a history of schizoaffective disorder and would sometimes fail to look after herself to the point where she would put herself at risk of dying. When I first met her I was conscious of my being younger than her and of a different ethnicity (I am black Caribbean). I took the time to really listen to what she had to say, including how she experienced her mental health problem. I would try to mirror what she said so that she knew I understood and I used my imagination to think about how she might have felt to be so vulnerable and distressed. At the same time I had to let her know what my duties were, particularly as an Approved Mental Health worker. That early engagement was really helpful when later it became evident that her mental health was deteriorating. My task was to provide support and protection, firstly by being someone she could talk to about her mental health, secondly by coordinating the work of the wider team and, thirdly, recognising when she would need protection. She would often not answer the door when I visited. After several attempts, I eventually applied for Jennifer to be compulsorily admitted to hospital where she could receive more specialist and intensive help. A year later she is much improved and we are still able to explore together some of the problems her mental health generates. I think she appreciates me ‘sticking’ with her.</p>
