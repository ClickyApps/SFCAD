    			<h1>Professionalism</h1>
    			<h6>Identify and behave as a professional social worker, committed to professional development.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers are members of an internationally recognised profession, a title protected in UK law. Social workers demonstrate professional commitment by taking responsibility for their conduct, practice and learning, with support through supervision. As representatives of the social work profession they safeguard its reputation and are accountable to the professional regulator.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Be able to meet the requirements of the professional regulator</li>
    				<li>Model the social work role, set expectations for others and contribute to the public face of the organisation</li>
    				<li>Expect supervision that covers practice, organisational and management aspects of role, applying critical reflection throughout</li>
    				<li>Model and help others to demonstrate professionalism</li>
    				<li>Model and help others with effective workload management skills</li>
    				<li>Model and help others to maintain professional/personal boundaries and skilled use of self</li>
    				<li>Maintain awareness of own professional limitations and knowledge gaps</li>
    				<li>Establish a network of internal and external colleagues from whom to seek advice and expertise</li>
    				<li>Contribute to a learning environment for self, team and, colleagues</li>
    				<li>Recognise and seek ways to promote well-being for team and colleagues</li>
    				<li>Promote up to date expectations about practice norms, identifying and helping resolve poor practice issues</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>At the Experienced Social Worker level you will need to show that you embody professionalism in all that you do, modelling appropriate behaviour and setting expectations for how others should behave. You are more likely to be working independently taking responsibility for your work, although under supervision, and showing others how to progress their knowledge and skills.</p>
    			<h3>The following illustration should help:</h3>
    			<p>In my work at the child development centre I provide a social work perspective within the wider multi-disciplinary team which includes paediatricians, occupational therapists, psychologists and others. I have developed a thorough understanding of attachment styles in children and parents and I have undertaken several training courses which have licensed me to assess attachment styles in both children and adults for example the Attachment Style Interview (ASI) and the Child Attachment Interview (CAI). Members of the multi-disciplinary team will often refer to me when there is a need to explore attachment styles in families at the centre. I try to keep up to date with this area of my practice by using resources in the centre library and through on-line sources available on the College of Social Work website. I have also taken out a subscription to the journal, Attachment and Human Development.  I have organised a fortnightly multi-disciplinary case discussion group where one person in the team presents a case for analysis and reflection by the group. With the help of a psychology colleague, we established the working methodology for the group which has been running for the past year. I have presented cases several times. I have established with my supervisor that for six months we will explore in supervision my own contribution to the work I do with families. I am interested in the effect I have with families and recognise from the feedback I have received that with some families I am more effective than with others. Concentrating on an area of my practice like this in supervision over a period of time has been helpful in challenging the assumptions I have about my work and I have been able to modify how I negotiate professional boundaries with parents and children. I have used this learning in discussion with colleagues from other professions and we have consequently had some really useful reflection on practice. Again the feedback from colleagues and my supervisor has been positive.</p>
