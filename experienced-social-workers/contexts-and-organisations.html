    			<h1>Contexts and Organisations</h1>
    			<h6>Engage with, inform, and adapt to changing contexts that shape practice. Operate effectively within own organisational frameworks and contribute to the development of services and organisations. Operate effectively within multi-agency and inter-professional partnerships and settings.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers are informed about and pro-actively responsive to the challenges and opportunities that come with changing social contexts and constructs. They fulfil this responsibility in accordance with their professional values and ethics, both as individual professionals and as members of the organisation in which they work. They collaborate, inform and are informed by their work with others, inter-professionally and with communities.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Contribute positively to the dialogue about opportunities and constraints for social work practice arising from changing local and national contexts and model proactive responses</li>
    				<li>Model and demonstrate the ability to work within your own organisation, and regularly work with the relationship between the organisation, practice and wider changing contexts</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate sound working knowledge of all relevant legal requirements, and their implications for practice; support and advise others to interpret and use the law</li>
    				<li>Engage positively with and contribute to organisational development</li>
    				<li>Identify the need for the development of specialist roles and their contribution to team learning</li>
    				<li>Model and encourage positive working relationships in the team, promoting strategies for collaboration and a supportive team culture</li>
    				<li>Maintain and develop liaison across agencies at a more senior level</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>At the Experienced Social Worker level you should be able to demonstrate that you have a more active role in the development of services in your authority and that you are taking broader responsibility for service delivery. In addition, your analysis of the impact of societal changes on the work you and your colleagues provide will be more detailed. You should be able to show that you are more actively involved with your team, helping colleagues to explore practice in more depth and developing collaboration with others to improve services.</p>
    			<h3>The following example is an illustration:</h3>
    			<p>As an experienced care manager for older people, I regularly commission additional services for my service users who are struggling to care for themselves in the community. I have the authority to commission services which will reduce the need for residential care and hospital admissions. I work closely with other professionals in the health service to coordinate our joint care of older people. By doing this I know that I am able to save money in the longer term since admission to care or hospital is very expensive. Saving money like this means that scarce resources go further, particularly for those in greatest need. My authority has set aside a budget for community care services and that budget is always under pressure. I know I therefore have to get value for money whilst also supporting service users. I am careful to ensure that I accurately complete the appropriate administrative processes for each service user, since getting it right first time is more efficient overall. I always help my colleagues do the same. I also recognise that there is greater scrutiny of community care services in society as a whole and there have been some notable incidents in the press involving the abuse of older people (BBC News 5th October 2013 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24399139). This makes my service users more anxious and I have to take time to alleviate their anxieties. At the same time I try to operate transparently by taking time to explain verbally and in writing what I am doing and what I am going to do, so that carers and other relatives can see exactly what I am doing and how I am making decisions. They have a right to be reassured about what happens in my authority. I represent the authority to people and I take that responsibility seriously. It is important that I involve service users and carers in the process. To do so upholds the values and ethics in my profession (BASW (2012) The Code of Ethics for Social Work. Birmingham).</p>
