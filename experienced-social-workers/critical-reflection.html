    			<h1>Critical reflection and Analysis</h1>
    			<h6>Apply critical reflection and analysis to inform and provide a rationale for professional decision-making.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers are knowledgeable about and apply the principles of critical thinking and reasoned discernment. They identify, distinguish, evaluate and integrate multiple sources of knowledge and evidence. These include practice evidence, their own practice experience, service user and carer experience together with research-based, organisational, policy and legal knowledge. They use critical thinking augmented by creativity and curiosity.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Model critical reflection and evidence-based decision-making, and support others in developing these</li>
    				<li>Provide professional opinion, giving the rationale and knowledge-base</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>At the Experienced Social Worker level you need to show that you can model good critically reflective practice and justify your decision making by reference to all of the evidence in a case. Remember it is easy to refer to evidence in cases, but it is more difficult to account for all of the evidence when coming to a conclusion.</p>
    			<h3>The following case example illustrates how you might do this:</h3>
    			<p>I was asked to review the evidence about an 86 year old woman in residential care who had apparently been assaulted. I had been provided with a medical report which showed that she had bruises to her face and forearm that were a couple of days old. The medical opinion was that it was impossible to determine whether these injuries had occurred deliberately. The police had interviewed the service user who was unable to tell them how the injuries had occurred. They had also interviewed the other residents and staff but nothing further was forthcoming. The home was described as Good in a recent inspection and there was no local information about increased numbers of complaints or any other contra indications. I asked the service user’s GP for an opinion since I was aware that following the stroke, Warfarin had been prescribed. I knew this was an anticoagulant and that consequently bruising might be more prevalent. The GP confirmed that it was possible that the Warfarin might be responsible but could not provide a conclusive judgement. I thought perhaps the medication was the most likely cause but nonetheless asked for the owners of the residential home to review all of their procedures for logging incidents since whatever the cause, the service users was clearly not observed closely enough by the staff. In addition, I also requested that the social worker should work more closely with the family of this service user who although not regularly involved, did visit her. Their continued oversight would also lend a protective factor to safeguard her health.</p>
