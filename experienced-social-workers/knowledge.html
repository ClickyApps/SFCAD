    			<p>Social workers understand psychological, social, cultural, spiritual and physical influences on people; human development throughout the life span and the legal framework for practice. They apply this knowledge in their work with individuals, families and communities. They know and use theories and methods of social work practice.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Develop knowledge in one or more specialist areas of your practice. Expand your knowledge to inform the connections between this and other settings or areas of practice</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate knowledge and application of appropriate legal and policy frameworks and guidance that inform and mandate social work practice. Apply legal reasoning, using professional legal expertise and advice appropriately, recognising where scope for professional judgement exists</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate and apply to practice a working knowledge of human growth and development throughout the life course</li>
    				<li>Recognise the short and long term impact of psychological, socio-economic, environmental and physiological factors on people’s lives, taking into account age and development, and how this informs practice</li>
    				<li>Recognise how systemic approaches can be used to understand the person-in-the-environment and inform your practice</li>
    				<li>Acknowledge the centrality of relationships for people and the key concepts of attachment, separation, loss, change and resilience</li>
    				<li>Understand forms of harm and their impact on people, and the implications for practice, drawing on concepts of strength, resilience, vulnerability, risk and resistance, and apply to practice</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate a critical knowledge of the range of theories and models for social work intervention with individuals, families, groups and communities, and the methods derived from them</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate a critical understanding of social welfare policy, its evolution, implementation and impact on people, social work, other professions, and inter-agency working</li>
    				<li>Recognise the contribution, and begin to make use, of research to inform practice</li>
    				<li>Demonstrate a critical understanding of research methods</li>
    				<li>Value and take account of the expertise of service users, carers and professionals</li>

    			<p>At the Experienced Social Worker level you have to show that you have developed a specialism(s).</p>
    			<p>I am a children’s mental health social worker, working with children in the public care system who present with significant mental health problems which affect their everyday ability to function and threaten placement stability (Ford, T et al (2007) Psychiatric disorder among British children looked after by local authorities: comparison with children living in private households British Journal of Psychiatry 190, 319-325) . I was recently consulted about work with Robert who has had a series of placement breakdowns in the past and whose current placement of three years has come to an end. From previous work with Robert I knew that at 7 he was described by school staff as behaviourally very challenging; they said he was a risk taker. He was described as numerically bright and quick witted but he is unable to write well. At 8 years old he is permanently excluded from school because he posed a risk to other children. At 9 I assessed him as having low average verbal skills. He fails to meet any educational targets and was diagnosed with mild bilateral hearing impairment. At 13 the Statement of Special Educational Needs notes that his cognitive function is below average, he has emotional and behavioural problems, his social and peer relationships are poor, he has fine and gross motor skills deficits, poor postural problems and sensory difficulties. In short Robert is likely to be exhibiting many of the symptoms of significant harm (Glaser, D (2000) Child Abuse and Neglect and the Brain: A Review Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 41, 1, 97-116). His current placement, which has just broken down, was the only one which had provided him with any measure of security and it is my assessment that it is vital that attempts should be made to repair it. At the very least the relationship between Robert and the foster mother should be maintained so far as possible. I have provided the social worker with assistance in how to encourage continued dialogue between them. I also think it is necessary to work separately with the foster mother to enable her to continue her parenting of Robert so far as possible.</p>
