    				<h1>The following illustration should help:</h1>
    				<p>In the case of D, a 9 year old boy who was hit on the ear by his dad, a case conference was convened. My manager insisted that I recommend that D should be subject to a Child Protection Plan and that his father should no longer reside at home. My view differed, since I could see that such a strategy would contravene the rights of both the father and his son (European Convention on Human Rights Article 8: Right to respect for private and family life.). It was clear to me that the family was under severe stress; they had three other children, one of whom had significant learning disabilities and particularly challenging behaviour. The incident occurred during a moment when the father was trying to control the disabled child and, whilst restraining him, he accidentally hit D’s ear. After the investigation, I discussed with the parents the vulnerabilities of their children when the family was under pressure, and we managed to work out how extra help from extended family members could be put to use to reduce stress and provide a break for them as carers. We drew up a plan together which they found helpful and which would negate the need for the father to live elsewhere. I used supervision to question the decision making within the context of both the European Convention of Human Rights and the Children’s Act 1989. We also discussed the impact of the father’s potential absence on D and we concluded that if this could be avoided then it would be preferable. After exploring all of the details in the case, my manager was confident that the children – and D especially – were safe to remain at home and we subsequently explored an alternative plan which did not require a case conference.</p>
    				<p>Alternative case examples could involve dilemmas emerging from partnership working particularly where you think it is important that to promote partnership or perhaps curtail it. In the latter instance you should be prepared to defend curtailment through a careful exploration of how it would promote other rights or duties.</p>
