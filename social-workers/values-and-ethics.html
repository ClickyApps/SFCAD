    			<h1>Values and Ethics</h1>
    			<h6>Apply social work ethical principles and values to guide professional practice.</h6>
    			<p>Social workers have an obligation to conduct themselves ethically and to engage in ethical decision-making, including through partnership with people who use their services. Social workers are knowledgeable about the value base of their profession, its ethical standards and relevant law.</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Demonstrate  confident application of ethical reasoning to professional practice, rights and  entitlements, questioning and challenging others using a legal and human rights framework</li>
    				<li>Critically reflect on and manage the influence and impact of own and others values on professional practice</li>
    				<li>Recognise and manage conflicting values and ethical dilemmas, in practice, using  supervision and team discussion, questioning and challenging others, including those from other professions</li>
    				<li>Negotiate and establish boundaries to underpin partnership work with service users, carers and their networks, using transparency and honesty</li>
    				<li>Ensure  practice is underpinned by policy, procedures and code of conduct to promote  individuals rights to determine their own solutions, promoting problem-solving  skills, whilst recognising how and when self-determination may be constrained  (by the law)</li>
    				<li>Work  to protect privacy and promote trust, whilst being able to justify, explain and take appropriate action when the right to privacy is over-ridden by professional or legal requirements</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>This capability is essentially about doing the right thing. Social workers are required to behave with probity not only with each other and with people from other professions but particularly with service users since the value base of the profession recognises that service users are often the least powerful people in society. When social workers make decisions they must do so in a way which demonstrates social work’s moral principles. When evidencing this capability you would do well to think about a case where you have had to struggle with making the right decision. The first capability statement says that you have to demonstrate ethical reasoning so you will have to show, in the case, how you weighted up the options available to you and how you came to a decision. Merely stating your decision would be insufficient. Your weighing up should make at least some reference to social work values like respect for human rights and self-determination. The following description would illustrate the approach you should take:</p>
    			<p>In the case of D, a 9 year old boy who was hit on the ear by his dad, a case conference was convened. My manager insisted that I recommend that D should be subject to a Child Protection Plan and that his father should no longer reside at home. I was less convinced of this strategy. It was clear to me that the family was under severe stress; they had three other children one of whom had significant learning disabilities particularly challenging behaviour. The incident happened during a moment when the dad was trying to control the disabled child and whilst restraining him he accidentally hit D’s ear. After the investigation and when the father was required to live elsewhere, I questioned the legality of making him do that and I could see that his absence was having a deleterious effect on D. I thought that D’s human rights were being infringed (right to family life) by my manager’s insistence on the dad leaving the house and I could see no legal justification for it. I tried to weigh up the merits of ensuring that dad was no longer a risk to the children with D’s need to have his dad at home and my manager’s abuse of power. I felt I had to be honest and express my view and I therefore challenged my manager in supervision and we were able to discuss the dilemma and reach a compromise which both D and his dad accepted.</p>
    			<p>Alternative cases might include those where you have had to negotiate about confidentiality or where you have had to maintain confidentiality in difficult circumstances. It is useful to remember that the maintenance of confidentiality is not only a personal matter for a service user but it is also a matter of public confidence. The public has the right to expect that certain matters will be kept confidential unless there is a proper defence for not doing so such as when children need protecting.</p>
